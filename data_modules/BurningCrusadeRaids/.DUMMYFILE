This file exists on both branches to stop git from deleting the BC data_modules subdirectories on branch switch.
(If it does that, it breaks my junction setup which lets the addon load on my client.)

This file should never be packaged by Curseforge. If it is, that's a bug. Tell me about it.

If you see this file in the repository, thanks for caring enough to check it out.
I hope you have a lovely day!
